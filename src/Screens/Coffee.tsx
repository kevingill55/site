        <span>STEP 1: HEAT KETTLE FULL OF COLD WATER TO 188°F - 196°F</span>
        <span>STEP 2: PREPARE DRIPPER, BASE, CARAFE, AND FILTER</span>
        <span>STEP 3: MEASURE 20 - 21 GRAMS OF COFFEE BEANS</span>
        <span style={{ padding: '3px 0' }}>ONCE WATER IS HEATED</span>
        <span>STEP 4: POUR WATER OVER FILTER INTO CARAFE, POUR WATER INTO MUG</span>
        <span>STEP 5: GRIND BEANS MEDIUM-FINE, SETTING 4</span>
        <span>STEP 6: DUMP WATER OUT OF CARAFE, SET DRIPPER WITH BASE AND CARAFE ON SCALE</span>
        <span>STEP 7: PUT GROUNDS INTO FILTER, DOUBLE CHECK MEASUREMENTS WITH SCALE</span>
        <span>STEP 8: SET GROUNDS IN FILTER AND MAKE A DIVOT WITH THE CHOPSTICK</span>
        <span>STEP 9: TARE SCALE, TURN OFF KETTLE, START TIMER, BEGIN POUR</span>
        <span>STEP 10: POUR WATER AS SLOWLY AND CONTROLLED AS POSSIBLE INTO THE DIVOT</span>
        <span>STEP 11: ASSESS THE REACTION FROM THE BEANS, CONTINUE SLOW POUR FOR 30-45 SECONDS</span>
        <span>STEP 12: POUR REMAINING WATER, 300-330 GRAMS TOTAL, IN CLOCKWISE CIRCLES COVERING ALL THE BEANS</span>
        <span style={{ padding: '3px 0' }}>ONCE POURING IS COMPLETE</span>
        <span>STEP 13: STIR GROUNDS WITH CHOPSTICK IN THE DRIPPER</span>
